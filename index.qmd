## Bio

I am a Master's student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School of Marine Science and Technology (UMassD SMAST), working on simulation modeling with a focus on fishery-independent survey design. My current thesis work uses quantitative and spatial tools to model species interactions and movements in response to offshore wind development to support current and future management decisions. Previously, I served as a Project Manager at the municipal government level focusing on stormwater permit compliance activities, watershed restoration goals, and database tracking needs. In all of these roles, I've worked to apply data science, scenario planning, and available tools to identify efficiency increases and potential mitigation strategies.
