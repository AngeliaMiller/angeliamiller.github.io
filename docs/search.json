    "text": "I am a Master’s student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School of Marine Science and Technology (UMassD SMAST), working on species distribution modeling and simulation testing with a focus on fishery-independent survey design. My current thesis work analyzes the impacts of offshore wind energy development in the northeast on the Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s (NEFSC) bi-annual bottom trawl survey, and its derived stock abundance indices to support future management decisions and to mitigate potential survey effort reduction. Previously, I served as a Project Manager at the municipal government level focusing on stormwater permit compliance activities, watershed restoration goals, and database tracking needs. In all of these roles, I’ve worked to apply data science, scenario planning, and available tools to identify efficiency increases and potential mitigation strategies."
